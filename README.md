# 6Ô∏è‚É£üî¢ MNIST Classification
MNIST dataset contains images of handwritten digits. With Convoluted Neural Networks, prediction of the digits would be performed. Basic implementation of convoluted neural network is performed in the repository.

The main aim of the project was to reduce the categorical cross entropy loss. Feel free to take a look at the repository where the various convoluted neural network implementations are performed. Thanks. 

## Directions to run the Ipython notebook 

1. You'll have to download and install Git that could be used for cloning the repositories that are present. The link to download Git is https://git-scm.com/downloads.
2. Once "Git" is downloaded and installed, you'll have to right-click on the location where you would like to download this repository.  
3. If you have successfully installed Git, you'll get an option called "Gitbash Here" when you right-click on a particular location. 
4. Once the Gitbash terminal opens, you'll need to write "Git clone" and then paste the link of the repository. 
5. The link of the repository can be found when you click on "Code" (Green button) and then, there would be a html link just below. Therefore, the command to download a particular repository should be "Git clone html" where the html is replaced by the link to this repository. 
6. Once downloaded, you might use the jupyter notebook to run the .ipynb files or other navigators to open this file.
