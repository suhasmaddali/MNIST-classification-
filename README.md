# 6Ô∏è‚É£üî¢ MNIST Classification
MNIST dataset contains images of handwritten digits. With Convoluted Neural Networks, prediction of the digits would be performed. Basic implementation of convoluted neural network is performed in the repository.

The main aim of the project was to reduce the categorical cross entropy loss. Feel free to take a look at the repository where the various convoluted neural network implementations are performed. Thanks.
